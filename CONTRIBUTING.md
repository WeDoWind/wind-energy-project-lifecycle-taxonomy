### Development (active members of the information modelling community)&#x20;

If you'd like to actively participate in the development and can commit 2 hours per month to discussions about information models in the wind energy domain, join the IEA Wind Task 43 community. The Work Group 1.2 (OntoForge) holds regular meetings and it'd be great to have you on board!

No specific technical knowledge is required. The taxonomy definitions are done in the Google Sheets, accessible by the members of the community.&#x20;

We use GitBook for an intuitive and user-friendly way to create, edit, and publish documentation relative to our community projects.

{% hint style="info" %}
Behind the curtains, work group leads store the Google Sheets in this open-source GitHub repository.  We use automated GitHub actions, to run xls2rdf tool, which converts the spreadsheets into the RDF model with TURTLE serialisation. But you do not have to worry about that.
