If you would like to provide your feedback, suggest edits or changes -  we use GitHub Discussions as a public forum, for wider community engagement. Domain experts are welcome to chime in the existing threads or start new ones.

### Development (active members of the information modelling community)&#x20;

If you'd like to actively participate in the development and can commit 2 hours per month to discussions about information models in the wind energy domain, join the IEA Wind Task 43 community. The Work Group 1.2 (OntoForge) holds regular meetings and it'd be great to have you on board!

No specific technical knowledge is required. The taxonomy definitions are done in the Google Sheets, accessible by the members of the community. Work Group leade stored in this open-source GitHub repository.   We use automated GitHub actions, to run xls2rdf tool which converts the spreadsheets into the RDF model with TURTLE serialisation.&#x20;

We use GitBook for an intuitive and user-friendly way to create, edit, and publish documentation relative to our community projects.
