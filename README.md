# WindPROFILE: Wind Energy Project Process and Life-cycle Taxonomy

WindPROFILE is a work-in-progress taxonomical organisation of planned processes (activities) in the wind energy domain according to the project life-cycle phases using a Simple Knoledge Organisation System (SKOS) data model.

The taxonomy can be viewed at TechoPortal, an ontology hosting catalogue for [engineering and technologyâ€‹ sciences](https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies/concept/-/resource?uri=http://data.europa.eu/8mn/euroscivoc/64605fff-1946-4fd4-b021-e2e83b71dcac\&lang=en) domain.
